            <h1>Who Is Kate Emily?</h1>
                <p>That would me, the impressive woman who is currently being considered for a position with your company. In addition to being me, I’m also a mom, daughter, sister, homeowner, and life-long learner who is working to trade in her admin hat for the more fashionable hero cape of the UX/UI Designer.</p>
                <p>I love being creative and expressing myself through all things creative. I find the human brain fascinating, green texts hurt my eyes, and my OCD-ish perfectionism is my Archilles’ Heel. My ADHD is my greatest creativity-inducing asset, and I often find myself “in the Zone” after I’ve spent an hour or so working on a style tile, only to realize I’ve been working on it for five hours! In short, I love the design tools and processes as much as I love a good cheesecake (and that’s a lot).</p>
                <p>My goal is to learn, learn more, and learn even more about UX/UI design. Additionally, I’d like to learn UX writing and add “and writer” to my title as well. Believe me when I say I have much to say… you know what I’m saying?</p>
                <p>In closing, I would like to say, “Thank you (insert your name here). I look forward to speaking with you about the many things I can do to help your company grow into the wildly successful business you’ve all been working toward.”</p>
